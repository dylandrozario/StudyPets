## Key Components

### Dashboard Component

The main dashboard provides:

- Interactive pet care buttons
- Real-time notifications

### Utility Functions

The `studyPetsUtils.js` file contains shared functionality:

## Data Storage

The application uses browser localStorage to persist:

- User settings and preferences
- Study session data
- Currency and achievements
- Blocked website attempts

## Styling

The application uses a glass morphism design system with:
- Semi-transparent backgrounds
- Backdrop blur effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Consistent color scheme with green accents

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Start development server

### Code Structure

- Components are functional components using React hooks
- State management uses React's built-in useState and useEffect
- Routing handled by React Router DOM
- Styling uses CSS modules and shared stylesheets
- Utility functions are modularized for reusability

## Preserved Features
